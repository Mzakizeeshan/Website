                <h2>Moment Obama raps Enimie's Lose Yourself at Detroit rally</h2>
                <p> 
                    Eminemm has introduced former US President Barack Obama at a
                    presidential campaign rally in Detroit. "I have done a lot of
                    rallies, so I dont usually get nervous", Mr Obama said. "But I was
                    feeling some kind of way following the last four years," he added.
                    The former president also said he was "honoured" to be asked to
                    perform at the event.
